In this Kaggle competition, we developed machine learning models that emulate subgrid-scale atmospheric physics in an operational climate modelâ€”an important step in improving climate projections and reducing uncertainty surrounding future climate trends.

We used a custom R-squared metric for evaluation, but on a weighted solution.

Dataset was extremely large like 300+GBs, so initially we prepared compressed batches of the dataset.

Then trained the model in each batch and ensembled the result.
